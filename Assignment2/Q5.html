                    <p>The partition of Syria refers to the ongoing division of the country resulting from the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011. The conflict has fragmented Syria into territories controlled by different factions, including the Assad-led government, opposition forces, Kurdish groups, and extremist organizations like ISIS. International involvement, with countries like Russia, the U.S., and Turkey supporting various sides, has further complicated the situation. This partition has devastated the nation, leading to significant loss of life, a massive refugee crisis, and widespread destruction of infrastructure, with little progress toward a unified resolution.</p>
